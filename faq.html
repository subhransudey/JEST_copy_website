                        JEST is a screening test for admission to PhD and Int. PhD program of different participating institutes (see the list from JEST home page) in physics and theoretical computer science/neuroscience. The JEST examination is only conducted for two subjects: physics and theoretical computer science.  However, the qualifications for admission to the PhD and Int. PhD program in various participating institutes is different. So the candidate is requiring visiting the websites of the participating institutes of their interest to know more about the qualification requirement.
